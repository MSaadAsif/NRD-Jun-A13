    "text": "Reference Studies:\n\nLiu et al., 2024\nLange et al., 2025\nBrlecic et al., 2025\n\nStudy Objective:\nTo evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on 30-day all-cause readmission among adult patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Secondary objectives included characterizing comorbid conditions, resource utilization, and identifying predictors of readmission within this population using a nationally representative dataset.\nData Source:\nThis retrospective cohort study used data from the 2016–2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), developed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NRD is a nationally representative, all-payer database of U.S. hospitalizations that allows linkage of patients across hospital stays within a calendar year. Survey weights, stratification, and clustering variables support complex sampling design for national estimates.\nCohort Definition:\nPatients were eligible for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria:\n\nAdults aged ≥18 years\nAECOPD diagnosis:\n\nEither a principal diagnosis of AECOPD based on specific ICD-10-CM codes:\n\nJ410, J411, J418, J42, J430, J431, J432, J438, J439, J440, J441, J449\n\nOr a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure (e.g., J9600, R0603) plus a secondary diagnosis of AECOPD\n\nZIP-based income quartile (ZIPINC_QRTL) not missing\nNon-elective admission\nIndex discharge by the end of November to allow for a complete 30-day follow-up period\nComplete data on LOS and NRD_DAYSTOEVENT, required to compute discharge dates\n\nSES Quartile Definition (ZIPINC_QRTL):\n\nSocioeconomic status was defined using the HCUP ZIP-based median household income quartile variable. This categorizes patients by the median income of their home ZIP code into four quartiles:\n\n1 = 0–25th percentile\n2 = 26th–50th percentile\n3 = 51st–75th percentile\n4 = 76th–100th percentile\n\n\nOutcomes of Interest:\n\nPrimary Outcome:\n\n30-day all-cause readmission (Yes/No), flagged using NRD linkage variables\n\nSecondary Outcomes (index admission):\n\nIn-hospital mortality (DIED)\nLength of stay (LOS, in days)\nTotal hospitalization charges (TOTCHG), inflation-adjusted to 2017 USD\nNon-home discharge\n\nReadmission Characteristics:\n\nIn-hospital mortality\nLength of stay (LOS, in days)\nTotal hospitalization charges (inflation-adjusted to 2017 USD)\n\n\nOutcome Definitions:\n\nReadmission:\n\nDefined using HCUP NRD’s methodology. Readmissions were identified only among patients with qualifying index events.\nTrauma-related hospitalizations were excluded only from the readmission pool to avoid unrelated admissions.\n\nMortality:\n\nIn-hospital death recorded during index or readmission (DIED = 1)\n\nLOS:\n\nReported in days; modeled as count outcome\n\nCharge:\n\nDerived from HCUP’s TOTCHG variable and adjusted to 2017 dollars using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data\n\n\nCovariates and Variable Construction:\n\nDemographic & Socioeconomic Factors:\n\nAge (continuous)\nSex (FEMALE; ref = Male)\nPrimary expected payer (Insurance; Medicare, Medicaid, Private, Other)\nWeekend admission (AWEEKEND)\n\nClinical Comorbidities:\n\nDerived from Elixhauser or Charlson comorbidity groups:\n\nDiabetes\nCongestive heart failure\nRenal failure\nHypertension\nObesity\nMyocardial infarction\nDepression\nDementia\nSolid tumor without metastasis\nAlcohol abuse\n\nAdditional Conditions:\n\nAsthma — identified using ICD-10-CM codes from secondary diagnoses\n\nAcute Severity Markers:\n\nMechanical ventilation – identified using procedure codes (5A1935Z, 5A1945Z, 5A1955Z)\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) – identified using secondary diagnosis codes (N17*)\n\n\nHospital & Admission Characteristics:\n\nHospital bed size (Small, Medium, Large)\nUrban/rural teaching status (Metropolitan, teaching vs non-teaching, etc.)\nNon-home discharge (e.g., SNF, hospice, other facilities, or death)\nLength of stay (LOS) – continuous variable (in days)\n\n\nStatistical Methods:\n\nSurvey Design and Weighting:\n\nAll analyses accounted for NRD’s complex survey design using weights (DISCWT), strata (NRD_STRATUM), and clustering (HOSP_NRD).
